  						<p>Poem. Novel. Essay. Here is a literary triptych whose panels swing from one another unfettered by geometry in wide and wild arcs. But there are hinges. Think of the upkeep of the minotaur at the center of what can only be the labyrinthine mind of Lucy Ives. This particular creature feeds on its own enclosure. Who said time is eternity turned into a moving image? How does this work on the page? As soon as Ives allows things focus, she pulls back, revealing a small component of a larger construct, but never anything objective and irreducibly whole. Thus, effectively her subject and obsession is not the demarcation of time, but the inability of time to be properly or comparatively enacted. What if Stein and Paul Éluard were a single poet? What if Wittgenstein, Elaine Scarry, and Charles and Ray Eames collaborated on a novelization of Terry Gilliam’s <em>Time Bandits</em>? What if Robbe-Grillet and Hélène Cixous were to re-write <em>The Duino Elegies</em> as an essay? Daedalus never built anything quite like this. Good luck getting out.</p>

						<p><em>The Worldkillers</em> is a strange and beautiful novel of numerology written in the course of a day; it is also a brilliant essay on description.  But it begins with singing.  Lucy Ives ushers us into her newest book via a series of mediations on repetition and transformation. “I saw” unfurls down the page, eventually becoming “I was,” but not before so many things turn in on, and thus into, themselves.  This is not some simple reconfiguration of Decartes’ “cogito ergo sum” whereby vision replaces thinking.  Neither thinking nor seeing are proof of being.  Ives reminds us that language, image, and description are merely operations we perform, beautiful and useful as they may be.  Nothing overrides “the physical world[’s]…indomitable reality,” try as we might to kill it.  In the face of our love and disregard for this world, Ives gives us a book so unsettling and so stunning that we “either say no words or weep into” the worlds she so generously offers.  These are worlds I gratefully receive.</p>

                         <p>Lucy Ives's <em>The Worldkillers</em> is so much fun. Like a sick-and-gorgeous dollhouse not-meant-for-kids and come-to-life. Or like a series of Daguerre's Dioramas with lights flickering in windows and pale blue smoke lifting out the chimneys. Anything might happen! Yet only one thing can, because this is a book. But will it be horrible? Gruesome? Grand? Someone will definitely get punched in the neck. The question is: will it be you?</p>
