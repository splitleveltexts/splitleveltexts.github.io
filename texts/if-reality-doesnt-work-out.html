  						<p>In this long poem of poems, each poem page reads as if it could be the last. <em>If Reality</em> represents the end of the world (the end of politics the end of love the end of the poet) in its middle. It is the poem I have wanted to write, the poem that approaches an expression of the pain of the success of Nothing, the united statesian/global obliteration of the shared space of the tragic upon which it proliferates. It is the poem about end, without end.</p>
						<p>--Rachel Levitsky</p>

  						<p>The unlivable days we never lived through. The opinions & assessments we performed & endured. The former was work. The latter sociality, no, wait, work, the latter was work. Both were dead & buried. Thusly, they had to be killed! But how, & when & where? These were the days of the feeds, those rivers of coffins & chickens, eggs & nails, poetry & money. One day in my feed I read a poem that so diligently scrambled all of this it forged an arrow, which shot through my heart. I heard Cupid say "nothing's ok.” Seduced, I followed him up to the cloud, & there I found him sleeping. Surveying his various clothes strewn about, I noticed a book in his pocket, it was <em>If Reality Doesn't Work Out</em> by Maged Zaher. I pocketed the volume myself, & tried to sneak off without notice. As I tip-toed away the cherub said "Spoiler Alert! It turns out that whole book is your heart." True story. This book's a big part of what comes first, next.</p> 
						<p>--Dana Ward</p>
						
						<p>Maged Zaher’s <em>If Reality Doesn’t Work Out</em> is a text made of “body and blood” in which our discerning and earnest global subject imbues versified sentential units with desire, loss, and a sweet buoyancy. This book is honest, strong, and bright as it navigates manifestation and dissipation, in love, in revolution, at once celebrating and mourning intimacy and its opposites.</p>
						<p>--Alli Warren</p>
